            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Hello there!</p>
            <p>  My name is Alex and i am junior PHP developer. </p>
            <p>
            Before getting job i studied programming by myself for 9 monthes. 
            I've learned programming basics of Java and basics data structures. Yes, i am PHP junior developer, even i studied programming with Java
            but PHP is similiar to Java.</p>
            <p>
                Now let me introduce you into this blog.
                I want to grow as professional developer. As a professional developer i should know algorithms and data structures.
                And i like it! It's interesting to create data structures such as List, HashTable, Trees and modify them.
                Also you can explore those structures, their working, effectiveness and complexity. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Why do you need know this all?
                For example, let's say we have the following task: we have a million employees.
                We store some of their data on our system. Before entering data into the database, we need to sort the employee data.
                How would you store data? In array or using Linked list? 
                Which algorithm would you use to sort data?
            </p>
            <p>
                So in this blog you can find a data structures, sources of their implementation and their usage in algorithms.
