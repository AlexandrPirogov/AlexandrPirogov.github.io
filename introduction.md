# Introduction

I am greeting everyone here!
My name is Alex Pirogov. I am working as junior php developer. 

Before getting the job, I studied programming myself for 9 months.
I've learned basics syntax of Java, basics algrorithms such as List, HashTable, Trees and etc...
Now i want to grow up as professional developer. One of the best tools for learning something new is reflection on the material covered. Own blog - is a great approach to prove your understanding of material. 
There are many disadvantages, but the main ones in my opinion:
1. You are tracking your studying. Self-study is a very difficult and lengthy process that requires patience and a lot of work, which gives results at a distance. Recorded blogs will be a kind of indicator of your progress, as well as a reflection of the result of your work.
2. Your are becoming more **responsible** in learning something new because your blogs gonna see anyone. Are you going to lie or mislead someone? Also you are learning to explain hard in simple terms.

Before creating a blog, i should choose a theme. 
But IT-industry has so many topics and i should choose **one**. And what exactly do i want to learn? Also my blog should be interesting for other users, not be like others. 

## What i would to learn and why

* **How is computer working.** As a surgeon knowing all the instruments and their purpose, developer should know about his instrument.
* **Algorithm theory.** To be honest i just like to work with algorithms theory. I like to sort arrays as fast as possible, create interesting data structers. 
* **Programming languages.** The more languages you know the more flexible developer you are. 
* **OS.** We write programs that work on OS. We should know advantages and disadvantages of OS and differences between operating systems.
* **Ethernet and networking.** Just the thing i would to understand.
* **Low-level programming.** Write a program - good. Create own computer - great.
* **Databases.** How to store data and how to manage it - interesting problem to solve. 
* **Cryptography**. Just the i'm interested in.

____

## The most interesting things in programming for me:

* **Programming mathematics tasks, models.**
* **Design**. 
* **Effectiveness and complexity of algorithms**
* **Multi-threading (concurensy)**
* **Cryptography**
* **Programming and Probabality theory**

## My uniqueness

* I am just like anyone

# So possible themes for blog:

1. Algorithms Theory. Effectiviness and complexety of algorithms in C++
2. Multithreading in programming in C++. Concurrensy.
3. The importance of math proving of programm correct
4. Becoming a creator of encode machine Enigma 2.0. Cryptography theory.
5. Learning math with programming.
6. Low-level programming. How computer understand our programms.
7. Mathematic methods and algorithms.


## What am i going to choose?

What can am i choosing?
I think Algorithms Theory is good one. Probably i'll change theme.
Algorithms inlcudes math (or math includes algorithms? ;) ), i'll learn new data structers, the ways to manage the data effectivly. Of course there are many sources with Algorithms Theory, but i think it's a good point to start.
