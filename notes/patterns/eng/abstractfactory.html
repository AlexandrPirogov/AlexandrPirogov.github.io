                <h1>Abstract factory</h1>
                <div>
                    <h2>Inent</h2>
                    Provide an interface for creating families of related objects without specifying their concrete class.
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h2>Applicability</h2>
                    Cases:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            A system should be independent of how its products was created, composed and represented.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            A system should be configured with one of multiple families of products.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            A family of related product objects is designed to be used together, and you need to enforce this constraint.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You want to provide to reveal only interface for creating objects, not their implementation.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h2>Schema</h2>
                    Here you can see schema of Abstract Factory Pattern:

                <div>
                    <h2>Example</h2>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h2>Source code example</h2>
                    Full source code you can see here<a href=""> on github</a>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h2>Consequences</h2>
                    <h3>Advantages</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Abstract Factory encapsulates the responsibilitiy and the process of creating objects and isolates clients from implementation classes.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            It makes exchanging objects families easy by changing the concrete factory.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            It promotes consinstency among objects families.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    <h3>Disadvantages</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Supporting new kind of objects families is hard. If we'll extends abstract factory we should define all subclasses methods.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Large count of objects families leads to large count abstract factory's methods.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
