            <h1>June 2021</h1>
            <p>This is the first self-education month.
            </p>
            <p> I've started to learn math, discrete mathematics (sets theory), 
                C++ and English.</p>
            <p>The reason for studying mathematics is as follows: while reading the book "The Art of Programming" by Knuth,
                I stumbled upon the difficulty of understanding fundamental mathematical things like sums, limits, functions, etc.
            I forgot all i've learned at university. To restore knowledge, i've started to read the next books:
                <ol>
                    <li>Precalculus. Mathematics for calculus. Authors: James Stewart, Lothar Redlin</li>
                    <li>Concrete mathematics. Author: Donald Knut</li>
                    <li>Discrete Mathematics for Computing. Author: Haggarty</li>
                </ol>
                <p>I've read about fundamentals like equations, inequalities and functions, their properties and graphs.
                Also I'm learning sets theory. </p>
            <p>The next subject is English. I'm sure that you'll find mistakes in my posts. I've started to practice english:
                test solving, listening, grammar, reading texts. It takes an hour per day. Right now I'm working with present simple and
                present continuous. I think the difference between present simple and present continuous is context.
                When you says about something in present simple you mean that you do it repeatedly. When you says about something in present continuous
                you mean that you've started do something but not finished. <br>
                For example:
                    <ol>
                        <li>"I run every morning" - You run every morning repeatedly. Present Simple 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            "Hello. I'm running. Can you call me later please?" - When you was running and someone called you and you haven't finished your running. 
                        </li>
                    </ol>
            </p>
            <p>What about C++?
                <br>I have fundamental knowledge of Java and PHP. I learned syntax, basics like loops, conditions and etc. 
                <br> A completly new things for me are pointers and destructors. All these months i was programming small tasks on CodeWars and was learning basics.
                That's it. Not too much but I'm trying to understand everything. I'm reading two books and found a new course about C++.
            </p> 
            <p>
                I didn't learn too much for my first self-education month. But it better to start slowly like you are running a marathon.
            </p>
            <h1> What do i plan for the next month?</h1>
            <p>With C++ i would take an OOP and finish working with memory.</p>
            <p>With Math I'm going to keep learning sets theory.</p>
            <p>Probably i'll write four posts about linked lists (theory + realization) and arrays</p>
            <p>And i would start to read something about computer architecture.</p>
