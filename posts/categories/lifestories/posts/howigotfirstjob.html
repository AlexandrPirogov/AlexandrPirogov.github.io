        <h2>How i've got my first job</h2>
        <p>This article is a story and to be honest reminder to myself as result of hard working.</p>
        <p>I'm going to start from the moment i joined to the university. At the moment of writing i'm 4s year student
            of small university Dubna. Direction - kind of Computer Science. </p>
        <p>It is worth to give an image of what kind of teenager i was. My favourite school subject is math. I had a small programming 
            experience with Java -- my first programming language but i didn't spend enough time for coding: i just didn't know what to 
            code. I wanted to create something big and complex, but it was too hard for me and easy tasks wasn't interesting for me.
            It was the first time i quite programming. 
        </p>
        <p>Then i joined to university to become developer. I though teachers will explain us how to create complex systems and code 
            greate programs. First year we had much math and some programming. Programming was too easy to me. My tasks were solved for minutes by me. 
            I didn't spend free 
            time for self-learning programming. I just didn't know what to google because i knew OOP and language basics, but still hadn't ideas what
            to code. Since this moment my IDE was used only for homework. It lasted till the end of second year of studying.  
        </p>
        <p>At the end of second year of studying i had a task to create a a program that calculated the best options for spending money on various projects.
            I didn't code anythink for 4-5 monthes and my thoughts was easy about this task. But when i've started to write a programm...i couldn't write
        a programm which takes values from two-dimensional array. That was bad. To be short i want to say when i did this task i decided that 
        i made a mistake with profession. And i was really upset.
        </p>
        <p>
            At summer 2019 i found a public about programming. There were many interesting posts about programming and computer science.
            The main moment there was a mentor that taught people programming. But he is very strict. It's hard to explain what hitted me in the 
            but i decided to learn programming. Again. Third time. Since the summer 2019 i've started learn with this mentor. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The main demand on his courses is hard working. If someone was too lazy he immediatly got banned. 
            You know first monthies i wasn't lazy but i didn't working hard. It was because of new experience of self-education. Without university. It was my choise
            to learn programming. I didn't used to waste time on...learning something new.
        </p>
        <p>The first monthes i solved task to remember how to code. Then in october i've started to learn algorithms on those courses. 
            You know when i wrote my first linked list with classes and method and the solution was ok i was so happy. I've wrote a programm that works.
            I've started to work harder.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the december when session was close i've got my first internship. That's it! "My first job is close to me", i thought. 
            I knew algorithms, java basics. The internship had the following stack of technologies: java spring, javascript, html, css, react. To be short - fullstack developer.
            I knew only java basics. So at the january all holidays i was studying html, css, js, and java spring. 10 hours per day.
            By the end of internship i was burned out and was kicked off. I took holidays of courses for 10 days to think about my future. 
        </p>
        <p>
            After small holidays i resumed learning programming. Also i've started to read books about programming and computer science.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the end of march i found vacancia for junior developer. I applied for job and sent my github profile. 
            I've got a call with invite for an interview. I passed it without any problems. And now i am junior PHP developer. (I learned PHP basics in two weeks).

            This story kind of introduction. But i want highlight the main moments:
                <ol>
                    <li>Learn while you have a time.</li>
                    <li>Be honest with yourself.</li>
                    <li>Find a mentor who'll help you to learn programming</li>
                    <li>Don't give up</li>
                </ol>
